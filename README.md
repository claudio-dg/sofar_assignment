## Setup

What and How To install useful thing for this project (ubuntu 18--tiago package--conveyor) and Hown to Run the simulation 


## Gazebo Environment

Image of the envirnoment/world
	
## Project structure and behaviour description

we show rqt graph and uml explaing the communication among nodes


 ### Behaviour description  : ### 

Flowchart explaining how the simulation works

	
	
 ## Code Explanation
 
We explain how detect color works (es subs to tiagos camera, take the image, convert and etc..) how we moved the arm using followjoint trajectory ecc

## Possible Improvements
 
use algorithm to detect obj pos. increase number of colors detected, detecting shapes In substitute/addition to colors.
