## Setup

What and How To install useful thing for this project (ubuntu 18--tiago package--conveyor) and Hown to Run the simulation 
The simulation is built on the ROS (Robot-Operating-Systems) platform, specifically the MELODIC version to be able to have the Tiago Ros package in it. Here the guide for Tiago installation Tiago robot. To use the melodic version it was necessary to work for the project on Ubuntu 18 which can be donwoloaded at Download Ubuntu 18.

The program requires the installation of the following packages and tools for the specific project before it can be launched:

## Project structure and behaviour description

we show rqt graph and uml explaing the communication among nodes


 ### Behaviour description  : ### 

Flowchart explaining how the simulation works

	
	
 ## Code Explanation
 
In the following sections we describe how we implemented the code to obtain the main behaviours of Tiago and Gazebo Simulation.
 ### Box Spawning  :   "```spawn_box_server.py```"
 
 ### Conveyor movements  : ### 
 
 ### Color Detection  : ### 
 
 ### Moving Tiago : ### 
 

## Possible Improvements
 
use algorithm to detect obj pos. increase number of colors detected, detecting shapes In substitute/addition to colors.
